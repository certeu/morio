# Morio ui

This is the Morio front end or **ui** for short.   
It is a static site built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

## Getting Started

First of all, since this is a monorepo you should follow the Getting Started
instructions in the README.md file in the root of this repository.

Once that is done, cd into this folder and run the following command to start the development server:

```bash
cd ui
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3010](http://localhost:3010) with your browser to see the result.
