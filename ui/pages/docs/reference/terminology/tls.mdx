title: TLS
---

Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a cryptographic protocol that provides secure
communication over an untrusted computer network.

TLS is commonly used to provide security for TCP-based protocols, most famously
it provides the S in HTTPS.

TLS is the successor of the now deprecated Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol,
and both terms are still in use to refer to encryption of network protocols in
broad terms.
