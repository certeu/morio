title: Morio Nodes
---

A Morio deployment can be made up of different node types:

**Broker nodes**  
A broker node is any Morio node that runs a RedPanda broker.  
You need at least one broker node to deploy Morio.

**Flanking nodes**  
A flanking node is any Morio node that does not run a RedPanda broker.  
Flanking nodes can be used to run flanking services, such as the UI or API.
