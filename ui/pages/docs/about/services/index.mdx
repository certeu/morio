Morio is composed of serveral (micro-)services that work together to provide
the Morio platform. They are divided into different service types:

**Morio Core**  
The [Morio Core](/docs/about/services/core) service must be deployed on each node in a Morio deployment.

**Distributed Services**  
The various distributed services must be deployed on all broker nodes. They are:

- [Operator API](/docs/about/services/api)
- [Broker Console](/docs/about/services/console)
- [Ingest API](/docs/about/services/ingest)
- [Kafka API](/docs/about/services/kafka)
- [Proxy](/docs/about/services/proxy)

**Flanking Services**  
The various flanking services can be deloyed on either broker or flanking nodes. They are:

- [Certificate Authority](/docs/about/services/ca)
- [Web Interface](/docs/about/services/ui)
