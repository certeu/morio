Morio's Core service handles orchestration and **co**nfiguration **re**solving for for
all other Morio services.

Core is the only service running with elevated privileges, which it needs to be
able to configure and orchestrate containers for the other Morio services.

<Note>
  The internal API of the Core service is not exposed to users. Instead, it is only accessible to
  other Morio services. However, much of [the Operator API](/docs/about/services/api)'a
  functionality is provided by the Core under the hood.
