title: Certificate Authority

Morio's internal certificate authority (CA) facilitates fully-automated
provisioning of X509 certificates for TLS encryption, authentication, and
access control. It is powered by
[step-ca](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-ca/index.html").

As Morio's internal CA is initialized when Morio is first deployed, each Morio
deployment has its own unique CA.
