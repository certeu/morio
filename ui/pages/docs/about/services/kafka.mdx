title: Kafka API
---

Morio is a streaming data platform, and we leverage
[RedPanda](https://redpanda.com) to provide those streaming capabilities.

RedPanda provides an Apache Kafka-compatible API, so if you know Kafka, you will find it very familiar.  
If you don't know Kafka, the news is even better: In comparison to Kafka, RedPanda is much easier to maintain and operate in production.
Which is why we chose it for Morio's streaming backbone.

The Kafka API uses mTLS for authentication, and does only allow encrypted connections. It listens on TCP port 9092.
