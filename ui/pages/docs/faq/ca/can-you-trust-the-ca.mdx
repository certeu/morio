title: Can you trust the internal Morio Certificate Authority?
---

Out of the box, Morio's internal Certificate Authority (CA) will not be trusted
by any of your systems. Your browser will complain when visiting the Morio UI,
and any software connecting to Morio will also be unhappy.

You may wonder whether you can you trust these certificates?

## Trust the encryption

Certificates are a requirement for TLS which allows us to encrypt traffic on
the network. You can trust that the certificates provided by Morio's internal
CA will keep your data secure while in transit.

## Verify the identity

Certificates can also be used to verify an identity. You should not rely on
Morio's internal CA for such verification. Instead, use your own judgement to
determine whether a remote party presenting a certificate issued by Morio's
internal CA is trustworthy.
