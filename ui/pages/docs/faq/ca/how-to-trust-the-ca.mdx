title: How can you establish trust for the internal Morio Certificate Authority?
---

To make those error messages in your browser go away, you need to trust the
certificates generated by this Morio's internal CA. There are different ways
you can accomplish this:

## Trust Morio's internal CA

The simplest solution is to add [the root certificate of Morio's internal
CA](/roots.pem) as a trusted root CA in your operating system's trust store.

- **Pro**: Easy to do; No infrastructure requirements
- **Con**: Needs to be done on every client connecting to Morio

## Cross-sign Morio's internal CA's intermediate certificate with your own CA

If you have your own internal CA, you can cross-sign the intermediate
certificate of Morio's internal CA. Doing so will make this CA a so-called
subordinate of your internal CA, and systems that trust your internal CA will
also trust certificates issues by this CA.

- **Pro**: Transparent to clients
- **Pro**: Requires only central changes
- **Con**: Requires an internal CA
