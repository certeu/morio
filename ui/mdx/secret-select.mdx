# Secret Selector

Morio's **Secret Selector** allows you to select a **secret** from
the [secrets defined in settings](/settings/tokens/secrets).

Secrets are typically used to hold sensitive data, such as passwords, or for
any data that is needed in the settings, but should not be visible.

<Note compact noP>
  Before you can select a secret, you must first create it.
