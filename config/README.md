# Morio Config

This folder holds configuration for various components of Morio.  
We refer to it as **config** for short.

It holds files with configuration for various Morio components. By
centralizing different configuration files, we want to make it easier for
people to find their way in this monorepo.

These files are imported directly, there is no build step, and there are no
dependencies.
