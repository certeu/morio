## Governance

Morio is a project by [CERT-EU](https://www.cert.europa.eu/), the
_Cybersecurity Service for the Institutions, Bodies, Offices and Agencies of
the [European Union](https://europa.eu/)_. It is CERT-EU's management under
supervision of the EU's _Interinstitutional Cybersecurity Board_ (_IICB_), who
have the final say on all things CERT-EU, including Morio.

The day to day management of the project is in the hands of CERT-EU's engineering team.
