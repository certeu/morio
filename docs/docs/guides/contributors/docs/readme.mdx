Improving our documentation is one of the easiest ways to start contributing to
Morio. So if you spot a mistake or see something that you can improve, please
do not hesitate to do so.

This guide will show you how you can do that.

<Tip>
### Making quick edits

The easiest way to make changes to the documentation is via the **Edit this
page** link that you can find at the bottom of every documentation page.

This will take you to the GitHub online editor where you can propose changes
directly.  
<small><b>Note:</b> You need a GitHub account to do this, but they are free.</small>
</Tip>

## Where to find our documentation

We store our documentation as [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) in git
and use [Docusaurus][docusaurus] to generate a static website from it,
which we then publish at [morio.it](https://morio.it/).

Inside our monorepo, the `docs` folder holds the docusaurus setup.
Within that folder, the `docs` subfolder holds the actual markdown content.

So, relative to the monorepo root, you can find the markdown of our documentation under `docs/docs`.

<Note>
Apart from documentation, we also publish blog posts using the same docusaurus setup.  
You can find those under `docs/blog`.
</Note>

## Folder structure & file names

The folder structure of the markdown files directly translates to the URL structure of the documentation website.
The file names must always be `readme.mdx`.

If we take this documentation guide as an example:

- Relative url: <b>/docs/guides/contributors/docs</b>
- Path to the markdown file: docs<b>/docs/guides/contributors/docs</b>/readme.mdx

That not only makes it easy to find the source markdown of any given page, it
also has implications for how you should structure the markdown content:

- All markdown files under `docs/docs` should be named `readme.mdx`
- All folders under `docs/docs` should have a URL-friendly name, using only the characters `a-z`, `0-9`, and `-`
- Every folder should have a `readme.mdx`, no empty folders

## Front matter

Front matter is metadata that sits at the top of a markdown file.
Strictly speaking, it is not part of markdown, but rather a list of key/value pairs in YAML format that starts and ends with `---`.
Here's an example:

```md
---
title: Documentation Guide
---

Improving our documentation is one of the easiest ways to start contributing to
Morio. So if you spot a mistake or see something that you can improve, please
do not hesitate to do so.
```

The `title` entry is mandatory. In other words, **every documentation page must
have its title set in front matter**.

As in YAML, you do not have to wrap your title in quotes, unless when it holds
characters that would trip up the YAML parser (like when your title itself
includes quotations marks).

<Note title="Supported front matter"> 
For an overview of all supported front matter, see [the Docusaurus documentation
on front matter in
docs](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs#markdown-front-matter)
</Note>

## Tags

The front matter example above can be further extended to add tags to the page.
Here is an example:

```md
---
title: Documentation Guide
tags:
  - contributors
---

Improving our documentation is one of the easiest ways to start contributing to
Morio. So if you spot a mistake or see something that you can improve, please
do not hesitate to do so.
```

We have added the `contributors` tag to this page, marking it as a page that is
relevant for Morio contributors.

Tags are a way to group pages together that cover the same topic or category.
Docusaurus will automatically create an overview page of all documentation that
is tagged with any given tag.

For example, the pages tagged with `contributors` can be found at
[/docs/tags/contributors](/docs/tags/contributors). Docusaurus will also
include the tags at the bottom of the page, and they link to their overview
pages.

Tags are most useful as a carefully curated collection of pointers.
To ensure that, all tags must be defined in the `docs/docs/tags.yml` file.

<Scode>
[github.com/certeu/morio/blob/develop/docs/docs/tags.yml](https://github.com/certeu/morio/blob/develop/docs/docs/tags.yml)
</Scode>

The file holds tags that can be defined as such (using our `contributors` tag as
an example):

```yaml
contributors:
  label: Contributors
  permalink: /docs/tags/contributors
  description: Documentation relevant for contributors
```

As you can see, you can explicitly set a label, permalink, and description.
However, we just rely on the defaults, so you will define the tag and do not specify any
properties. Here is how to do that in YAML:

```yaml
contributors:
```

To add a tag, place it on a new line followed by `:`.

<Tip>
An overview of all tags is available at [/docs/tags](/docs/tags).
</Tip>

## Custom components

Docusaurus supports _MDX_ which is markdown with support for custom components.
A number of MDX components are supported out of the box, like [the tabs used on
this page](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/tabs).

In addition, we provide some MDX components that you can use in documentation pages. They provide various ways to engage the reader with the material.

### Comment

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Jargon and Terminology

It is common in technical documentation to use terms or acronyms that the
reader might not be familiar with. This can create a barrier to readers,
especially when those terms are specific to Morio.

To address this, we have extended Docusaurus with two custom features that help you demystify this type of content: **jargon** and **terminology**.

### Jargon vs Terminology

Both jargon and terminology can be anything that needs explaining.
The difference is that jargon does not warrant or require its own dedicated documentation page.

The following rules can guide you when deciding whether you should create a
jargon term, add a terminology page, or take no action.

1.  Is someone new to Morio expected to know this?
2.  Would a simple Google search explain this?
3.  Does this warrant its own documentation page?

If the answers are **No**, **No**, **Yes**, create a terminology page.  
If the answers are **No**, **No**, **No**, [create a jargon term](#creating-a-jargon-term).  
For all other cases, no action is required.

The decision tree below visualises these rules:

<WithCaption caption="A decision tree to facilitate decisions about whether or not to create jargon or terminology">

```mermaid
graph TD;
  noop["No action\nneeded"]
  1["Is someone\nnew to Morio\nexpected to know this?"]
  2["Would a simple\nGoogle search\nexplain this?"]
  3["Does this warrant its\nown documentation page?"]
  jargon["Create a jargon entry"]
  terminology["Create a terminology page"]
  1-- Yes -->noop
  1-- No -->2
  2-- No -->3
  2-- Yes -->noop
  3-- No -->jargon
  3-- Yes -->terminology
```

</WithCaption>

Let's use some examples to further clarify these rules:

#### `IICB`: Create jargon term

1. This is something rather niche that has little to no meaning outside the context of European Union's administration.
2. People cannot be expected to know this, and a simple Google search is unlikely to help.
3. Knowing what the IICB is not relevant for understanding Morio. So a dedicated documentation page is not needed.

In this case, we create a jargon term: _IICB_.

#### `flanking node`: Create terminology page

1. This has a specific meaning in Morio and people cannot be expected to know this.
2. Googling this won't help.
3. This requires proper explanation. A documentation page is the best option here.

In this case, we create a terminology page: _flanking node_.

#### `TLS node`: Do nothing

1. This is common terminology, people are unlikely to be confused by this. But even if they are...
2. A simple Google query will explain this.

In this case, we do nothing.

### Jargon

#### Creating a jargon term

To create a new jargon term, create a `name.md` file under <RepoFile>docs/docs/jargon</RepoFile>.
The `name` of the file should follow [the same rules as folders under
`docs/docs`](#folder-structure--file-names): use only the characters `a-z`,
`0-9`, and `-`.

Inside the your `.md` file, you can use markdown content like in a regular documentation page.

#### Jargon properties

Jargon terms have the following properties that are used to render them on the page:

- `title`
  - **description**: The title used when displaying the jargon term's info
  - **default**: The file's _uppercased_ basename
  - **custom**: The front matter `title` value
- `term`
  - **description**: The term that will trigger rendering the jargon term when emphasised
  - **default**: The file's _lowercased_ basename
  - **custom**: The front matter `term` value
- `aliases`
  - **description**: A list of additional terms that will trigger rendering the jargon term when emphasised.
  - **default**: none
  - **custom**: The front matter `aliases` value (an array of strings)
- `content`
  - **description**: The main content when displaying the jargon term's info
  - **default**: The file's markdown content
  - **custom**: none

#### Examples

Let's use two examples to illustrate the use of default versus custom values for jargon properties:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="mdx" label="Default" default>

This <RepoFile>docs/docs/jargon/mdx.md</RepoFile> example uses only defaults.

- title: `MDX` (the uppercased basename is used as default)
- term: `mdx` (the lowercased basename is used as default)
- aliases: `[]` (no aliases is default)

In a case like this, your markdown file does not need any front matter:

```md title="docs/docs/jargon/mdx.md"
MDX lets you use JSX in your markdown content. It allows you to import
components, and embed them within your content. This makes writing markdown
with custom components a blast.

Learn more at [mdxjs.com](chttps://mdxjs.com).
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="html" label="Custom">

This <RepoFile>docs/docs/jargon/run-files.md</RepoFile> example uses custom properties.

- title: `Run scripts` (default would have been `run-scripts`)
- term: `run scripts` (default would have been `run-scripts`)
- aliases: `['run script']` (default would have been no aliases)

In this case, all customisation is handled in the front matter:

```md title="docs/docs/jargon/run-scripts.md"
---
title: Run scripts
term: run scripts
aliases:
  - run script
---

NPM run scripts, or **run scripts** for short, refer to scripts defined in the
**scripts** section of a NodeJS **package.json** file. These scripts are
typically used for all sorts of housekeeping an automation.

For more info, refer to [the NPM docs on
scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/using-npm/scripts).
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Note>
#### This relies on the work done by the prebuild step

When running docusaurus locally in develop mode, you will need to run `npm run
prebuild` in the `docs` folder to ensure this works.
</Note>

#### Using a jargon term

Once you have created a jargon term, you can use it by _emphasising_ it in your markdown content.

For example, this markdown:

```md
I have no idea what _mdx_ is.
```

Will render as:

I have no idea what _mdx_ is.

The jargon term will be turned into a button that you can click to reveal the meaning of the term.

<Tip>
#### Jargon terms are case-insensitive
You can write _mdx_, _MDX_, or even _mDx_, they will all trigger rendering the `mdx` jargon term.
</Tip>

#### List of jargon terms

The following jargon terms are currently available for use in your markdown content:

<JargonTerms />

### Terminology

#### Creating a terminology page

To create a new terminology page, create a folder under `/docs/docs/reference/terminology`.  
The name of the folder should follow [the same rules as any folders under
`docs/docs`](#folder-structure--file-names): use only the characters `a-z`,
`0-9`, and `-`.

Then, add a `readme.mdx` file to the folder as you would for any documentation page.

#### Terminology properties

Terminology terms have the following properties that are used to render them on the page:

- `title`
  - **description**: The text used when displaying the terminology link
  - **default**: The front matter `title` value
- `term`
  - **description**: The term that will trigger rendering the terminology link when emphasised
  - **default**: The file's _lowercased_ basename with dashed replaced by spaces (`core-service` becomes `core service`)
  - **custom**: The front matter `term` value
- `aliases`
  - **description**: A list of additional terms that will trigger rendering the terminology link when emphasised.
  - **default**: none
  - **custom**: The front matter `aliases` value (an array of strings)

Below is an example:

```md title="docs/docs/jargon/mdx.md"
---
title: Core Service
aliases:
  - core
tags:
  - core
---

The **Morio Core Service** (core) sits at the root of any Morio deployment and is
responsible for [orchestration](#orchestration), [configuration
resolution](#configuration-resolution), and [clustering](#clustering).

To learn more, visit [the Core Service guide](/docs/guides/services/core).
```

#### Using a terminology term

Once you have created a terminology term, you can use it by _emphasising_ the page title in your markdown content.
This will turn the terminology term into a link that leads to the terminology page:

```md
I want to learn more about _core_. Is it the same as the _core service_?
```

Will render as:

I want to learn more about _core_. Is it the same as the _core service_?

<Tip>
#### Terminology terms are case-insensitive
You can write _core_, _CORE_, or even _cORe_, they will all trigger rendering the `core` terminology link.
</Tip>

#### List of terminology pages

The following terminology pages are currently available for use in your markdown content:

<TerminologyTerms />

## Includes

Sometimes, you may find yourself repeating the same information on various
documentation pages. You could create a page for it and link to it, but
perhaps it's more elegant to inline the information in the page.

In a case like this, you can use an include. This allows you import _MDX_
content into your documentation page.

### Creating an include page

To create an include page, add the page to the <RepoFile>docs/includes</RepoFile> folder in the _monorepo_.

Unlike the <RepoFile>docs/docs</RepoFile> folder where we rely on folder
structure, all files should be in the same folder.

As such, you should give it a name that conveys the intent of the include.
As a practical example, the difference between the built container images for
the development environment and production is something that is relevant on
various documentation pages.

So, the documentation is kept in the <RepoFile>docs/includes/docker-env-diffs.mdx</RepoFile> file.

### Importing and using the include file

Once created, you can import the file as any other import in your `readme.mdx`:

```mdx
---
title: Example of how to use an include
---

import DockerBuildEnvDiffs from '@site/includes/docker-env-diffs.mdx'

Some (optinoal) other content here.

<DockerBuildEnvDiffs />
```

A few things to note:

- The `import` statement should be the first thing after the front matter
- Use the `@site/includes/` prefix to import include files.
- Since we are using the default export, the name you give it can by anything (here we used `DockerBuildEndDiffs`
- This will be used as a React component, so you **must** pick a name that starts with a capital letter
- Output the info as a React component: `<DockerBuildEnvDiffs />`

See <RepoFile>docs/reference/contributors/monorepo/run-scripts/build-api/readme.mdx</RepoFile> for an example.

## Tips for writing great documentation

Here is some friendly advice to help you write great documentation:

#### Don't use gen-AI

Writing yourself will make you a better writer.

<Note>
We take pride in the fact that all of Morio's documentation is written by actual human beings.  
Please respect that and don't reach for ChatGPT or whatever the generative AI flavour of the day is.
</Note>

#### Write now, edit later

Just write. Don't worry about grammar or making mistakes. It's fine.

It doesn't have to be perfect, it just needs to be written down.

Anybody can edit to improve form or structure,
and the [`spellcheck`](/docs/reference/contributors/monorepo/run-scripts/spellcheck)
and [`ci:spellcheck`](/docs/reference/contributors/monorepo/run-scripts/ci-spellcheck)
_run scripts_ are there to help with spelling.

#### Use plain language

Explain things in simple words. Write short plain sentences.
Use headings and paragraphs to structure your writing.

#### Get to the point

Say what you need to say -- no more, no less.  
Make your text as short as possible; your documentation will be better this way.

#### Use meaningful titles and hyperlinks

Page titles should be meaningful without context. They are the main result in
search, so strive to make them meaningful and informative on their own.

That often means making your titles a lot longer, which doesn't work well in
the navigation sidebar. You can use the `sidebar_label` key in front matter to
set a different title to use in the sidebar.:

To a lesser extend, the same advice applies to links:

- Bad: You can find the info [here][yt].
- Good: You can find the info [by watching this YouTube video with 1.3 billion views][yt]

[yt]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ

#### Define jargon

Don't use jargon without explaining it.

#### More advice

The ["Technical Writing From Google" course](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/one) comes highly recommended.

Remember that the worst possible documentation is the documentation that is never written.

## Running the documentation site locally

<Note>
We assume you have git and NodeJS installed.
</Note>

To run a local instance of the documentation site -- highly recommended if
you're looking to make non-trivial changes to the documentation -- you can
follow these steps:

```sh title="Terminal"
git clone git@github.com:certeu/morio.git
cd morio
npm install
cd docs
npm run start
```

In other words:

- Clone the repository
- Install dependencies
- Run `npm run start` in the `docs` folder

The docs site will now be running on http://localhost:3000 and any changes you
make will be hot-reloaded.

<Warning>
#### Untested on Windows

While we support Microsoft Windows as a platform for the Morio client, no Microsoft Windows is used in the development of Morio.
If you are on Windows, your mileage may vary.
</Warning>

## Redoc Integration

We generate our API reference documentation by
using [redocusaurus](https://github.com/rohit-gohri/redocusaurus) which
integrates [redoc](https://github.com/redocly/redoc)
in [docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).

The configuration is part of <RepoFile>docs/docusaurus.config.js</RepoFile> and
it adds these two routes:

- [/oas-api](/oas-api) for the Management API
- [/oas-core](/oas-core) for the Core API
