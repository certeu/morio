title: Core API Guide
---

The Morio Core API is an [OpenAPI v3.1](https://swagger.io/specification/)
compliant API internal to Morio and -- with the exception of a few endpoints --
is not accessible to users.

<Note>
#### This API is safe to ignore
The most important thing to know about the Core API is that
you can safely ignore it. It is internal to Morio, and users or even
administrators of Morio should never have to use it.

</Note>

This guide is intended for (aspiring) contributors, or anyone who would like to
gain a deeper understanding of how Morio works under the hood.

<Tip>
#### Core API Reference Documentation

If you're already familiar with the API, and are merely looking
for for answers on which endpoint to use or what data to expect, refer to
[/docs/reference/apis/core](/docs/reference/apis/core).

## Purpose of Morio's Core API

Morio's Core API (the API) provides functionality that spans various domains:

- **Cluster**: Accept Morio cluster invites from other nodes, and process the cluster heartbeat.
- **Cryptography**: Generate X.509 certificates and encrypt or decrypt data on demand
- **Docker**: Getting information from the Docker Daemon, restarting containers, and other Docker-related tasks
- **Client Packages**: Build client packages or provide their defaults
- **Settings**: Handle initial setup as well as updates to the Morio settings
- **Status**: Provide a consolidated status of all Morio services

## Accessing the API

<Note>
### Most Core API endpoints are not exposed
As this is an internal API, the only endpoints that are available from the network are
the `/status` endpoint and the `/cluster/join` and `/cluster/heartbeat` endpoints.
</Note>

The API itself is available on all Morio nodes, and can be accessed under the
prefix `/-/core/`.

All documentation of API endpoints is relative to this prefix. So to access
the `/status` endpoint of this API on a Morio node, you should use:
```
https://[your-server-name]/-/core/status
```

If your server's DNS name
is `example.morio.it` , you could run this curl command to get the `/status`
endpoint:

```title=curl
curl https://example.morio.it/-/core/status
```

Or, if your system does not trust the Morio certificates:

```title=curl
curl --insecure https://example.morio.it/-/core/status
```

## Authentication

As an internal API, the Core API does not use or support authentication.
Most of its endpoints are not available on the network, but only internally.

Given that this API does not use authentication, it is worth going over the
routes that are available on the network and explain why no authentication is
used:

### The `/status` endpoint

Just as in [the Management API](/docs/guides/apis/api), this is a public or
anonymous route. So no authentication is required.

<Note>
#### Included in the `/status` endpoint of the Management API

The [Management API](/docs/guides/apis/api) includes the core status in its own
`/status` endpoint. So you do not need to hit this endpoint, you can use the
regular API and check the `core` key for the core-specific status.

</Note>

### The `/cluster/join` endpoint

Perhaps counter-intuitively, this too is a public or anonymous route.
However, it is only available while Morio is running in _ephemeral mode_.
While in _ephemeral mode_ Morio will eagerly await either its initial setup, or
a cluster join request.

In other words, once Morio has received its initial settings, this endpoint
will no longer be available, and instead return [an error response of type
`morio.core.ephemeral.required`
](/docs/reference/errors/morio.core.ephemeral.required/).

### The `/cluster/heartbeat` endpoint

While this too is a public or anonymous route -- by which we mean that no
authentication headers are required -- the cluster heartbeat payload will be
cryptographically signed and verified on each end.

This is done by including a checksum that holds a sha-256 hash of the
combination of the payload data, the Morio Root Token, and the password of the
internal secret key.

The checksum will be verified on both ends, thus guarding this endpoint against
abuse.
