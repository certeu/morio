The **Morio RedHat Builder Service** (rbuilder) is an on-demand service that builds
Morio client packages in `.rpm` format, the package format used by
RedHat-based Linux distributions.

As an on-demand service, it is not running all the time, instead it is started
by [the core service](/docs/guides/services/core) whenever a `.rpmn` client
package needs to be built.
