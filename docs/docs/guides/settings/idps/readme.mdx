title: Identity Providers Guide
---

In Morio, all HTTP-based authentication is backed by Identity Providers (IDPs),
a modular way to configure authentication backends for your Morio deployment.

Morio supports the following types of identity providers:

- [**Morio Root Token**](#morio-root-token)
- [**Morio API Keys**](#morio-api-keys)
- [**Morio Accounts**](#morio-accounts)
- [**LDAP**](#ldap)
- [**OpenID Connect**](#openid-connect)

## Morio Root Token

The **Morio Root Token** identity provider (`mrt`) allows authentication with
the Morio Root Token.

**Purpose**

- The `mrt` identity provider is intended to be used as the very first Morio login
  before other identity providers are set up.
- The `mrt` identity provider also serves as a sort of _break glass_ fallback
  that can be used when other identity providers are unavailable.

**Restrictions**

- The `mrt` identity provider requires the _Morio Root Token_ to authenticate,
  which is created at the initial setup of Morio, and only shown at that time.
- The `mrt` identity provider only takes the _Morio Root Token_ as input --
  there is no username.
- You can only have 1 instance of the `mrt` identity provider.

**Provider-specific functionality**

- This is the only identity provider that can grant the `root` role.

**Roles**

- The `mrt` identity provider grants you the `root` role, the highest role in a
  Morio system.
- The `mrt` identity provider supports dropping privileges by requesting any
  role lower than `root`.

**Configuration**

- The `mrt` identity provider is built-in and does not require configuration.
- The `mrt` identity provider can be disabled with the
  [`DISABLE_IDP_MRT`](/docs/reference/flags/disable_idp_mrt/) feature flag.
- The `mrt` identity provider's inclusion or appearance on the UI's login page
  can be configured in the UI settings.

**Settings Example**

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="a" label="Base Settings">
```yaml title="base-settings.yaml"
iam:
  providers:
   mrt:
     # A label is optional 
     # Defaults to the ID of the identity provider (mrt)
     mrt: Morio Root Token
  ui:
    visibility:
      # Use 'icon' to hide the identity provider 
      # behind a lock icon on the login page
      mrt: icon
    order:
      mrt: 10
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="b" label="Settings Overlay">
```yaml title="overlays/idp-mrt.yaml"
iam.ui.providers.mrt.label: Morio Root Token
iam.ui.visibility.mrt: icon
iam.ui.order.mrt: 10
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Morio API Keys

The **Morio API Keys** identity provider allows authentication with a Morio API
Key and its matching secret.

**Purpose**

- The `apikey` identity provider is intended for automated access, scripts,
  CI/CD pipelines, cron jobs, and so on.
- The `apikey` identity provider is not intended for human operators, although
  it is commonly used by developers when working on Morio API integration.

**Restrictions**

- The `apikey` identity provider does not allow choosing the API Key (username)
  or Secret (password).
- The `apikey` identity provider does not support dropping privileges by
  assuming a different role -- only the role assigned to the API Key can be
  used.
- You can only have 1 instance of the `apikey`identity  provider, and its ID
  must always be `apikey`.

**Provider-specific functionality**

- The `apikey` identity provider allows creating API Keys by any Morio user.
- The [Morio Management API](/docs/guides/apis/api) provides [various endpoints
  to handle API Keys](/docs/reference/apis/api#tag/apikeys).

**Roles**

- The `apikey` identity provider allows for any role up to `engineer`. The
  `root` role cannot be assigned to an API Key.
- The `apikey` identity provider does not allow creating an API Key with a role
  higher than one's own.

**Configuration**

- The `apikey` identity provider is built-in and does not require
  configuration.
- The `apikey` identity provider can be disabled with the
  [`DISABLE_IDP_APIKEY`](/docs/reference/flags/disable_idp_apikey/) feature
  flag.
- The `apikey` identity provider's inclusion or appearance on the UI's login
  page can be configured in the UI settings.

**Settings Example**

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="a" label="Base Settings">
```yaml title="base-settings.yaml"
iam:
  providers:
   apikey:
     # A label is optional 
     # Defaults to the ID of the identity provider (mrt)
     label: API Key
  ui:
    visibility:
      # Use 'icon' to hide the identity provider 
      # behind a lock icon on the login page
      apikey: icon
    order:
      apikey: 20
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="b" label="Settings Overlay">
```yaml title="overlays/idp-apikey.yaml"
iam.providers.apikey.label: API Key
iam.ui.visibility.mrt: icon
iam.ui.order.mrt: 10
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Morio Accounts

The **Morio Accounts** identity provider allows authentication with the
username, password, and TOTP token of a Local Morio User Account.

**Purpose**

- The `local` identity provider is intended for access by humans.
- The `local` identity provider is most suitable for smaller setups where no
  centralised identity provider -- such as [OpenID Connect](#openid-connect) or
  [LDAP](#ldap) -- is available, or as a backup when external identity
  providers are down.

**Restrictions**

- The `local` identity provider requires Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
  This is mandatory and cannot be disabled.
- You can only have 1 instance of the `local` identity provider, and its ID
  must always be `local`.

**Provider-specific functionality**

- The `local` identity provider allows any user with the role `manager` or
  higher to create local Morio accounts.
- The `local` identity provider generates an invite code and URL to be shared
  with users, facilitating onboarding.
- The `local` identity provider will provide _scratch codes_ to the user that
  can be used when their device used to generate the TOTP token is unavailable.
- The [Morio Management API](/docs/guides/apis/api) provides [various endpoints
  to handle Local Morio Accounts](/docs/reference/apis/api#tag/accounts).

**Roles**

- The `local` identity provider allows for any role up to `engineer`. The
  `root` role cannot be assigned to a Local Morio Account.
- The `local` identity provider does not allow creating a local Morio account
  with a role higher than one's own.

**Configuration**

- The `local` identity provider is built-in and does not require configuration.
- The `local` identity provider can be disabled with the
  [`DISABLE_IDP_LOCAL`](/docs/reference/flags/disable_idp_local/) feature flag.
- The `local` identity provider's inclusion or appearance on the UI's login
  page can be configured in the UI settings.

**Settings Example**

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="a" label="Base Settings">
```yaml title="base-settings.yaml"
iam:
  providers:
   local:
     # A label is optional
     # Defaults to the ID of the identity provider (local)
     label: Morio Account
  ui:
    visibility:
      # Use 'tab' to show the identity provider 
      # as a tab on the login page
      local: tabs
    order:
      local: 3
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="b" label="Settings Overlay">
```yaml title="overlays/idp-local.yaml"
iam.providers.local.label: Morio Account
iam.ui.visibility.local: tab
iam.ui.order.mrt: 3
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## LDAP

The **LDAP** identity provider allows authentication against an LDAP backend.

**Purpose**

- The `ldap` identity provider is intended for organisations that have
  pre-existing user identities available in an LDAP server or a system
  compatible with LDAP, such as Microsoft Active Directory.
- The `ldap` identity provider is most suitable for environments where users
  already have an account on a different system that they also want to use to
  access Morio.

**Restrictions**

- None.

**Provider-specific functionality**

- The `ldap` identity provider allows configuring the assignment of Morio roles
  based on any field of the LDAP user object.
- The `ldap` identity provider supports more than 1 instance of this provider,
  thus allowing you to use different LDAP backends simultaneously.

**Roles**

- The `ldap` identity provider allows for any role up to `engineer`. The `root`
  role cannot be assigned to a user backed by the `ldap` identity provider.

**Configuration**

- The `ldap` identity provider needs to be configured before it can be used.
- The `ldap` identity provider can be disabled with the
  [`DISABLE_IDP_LDAP`](/docs/reference/flags/disable_idp_ldap/) feature flag.
- The `ldap` identity provider's inclusion or appearance on the UI's login page
  can be configured in the UI settings.

**Settings Example**

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="a" label="Base Settings">
```yaml title="base-settings.yaml"
iam:
  providers:
    ad: # You can choose the ID of the ldap provider instance
     provider: ldap # You cannot choose this, it must always be `ldap`
     label: Active Directory
     about: This is your Active Directory account, the same you use to login to your computer.
     server:

</Tabs>


## OpenID Connect

The **OpenID Connect** identity provider allows authentication against an OpenID Connect (`oidc`) provider.

**Purpose**

- The `oidc` identity provider is intended for organisations that have
  pre-existing user identities available in a system that supports OpenID
  Connect.
- The `oidc` identity provider is most suitable for environments where users
  already have an account on a different system that they also want to use to
  access Morio.

**Restrictions**

- None.

**Provider-specific functionality**

- The `oidc` identity provider allows configuring the assignment of Morio roles
  based on any user property provided by the OpenID provider.
- The `oidc` identity provider supports more than 1 instance of this provider,
  thus allowing you to use different OpenID providers simultaneously.

**Roles**

- The `oidc` identity provider allows for any role up to `engineer`. The `root`
  role cannot be assigned to a user backed by the `oidc` identity provider.

**Configuration**

- The `oidc` identity provider needs to be configured before it can be used.
- The `oidc` identity provider can be disabled with the
  [`DISABLE_IDP_OIDC`](/docs/reference/flags/disable_idp_oidc/) feature flag.
- The `oidc` identity provider's inclusion or appearance on the UI's login page
  can be configured in the UI settings.
