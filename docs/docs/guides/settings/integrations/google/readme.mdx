You can integrate [Google's OpenID Connect
implementation](https://developers.google.com/identity/openid-connect/openid-connect)
with Morio to act as an identity provider.

This allows people to use their Google account to authenticate to Morio.
To do so, you need to configure [an OpenID Connect identity
provider](/docs/guides/settings/idps/#openid-connect) with Google as the
backing OpenID provider.

To do so requires configuring a project in Google's console, and then using the
details of that project to set up a new identity provider in Morio. 
You also need to ensure Morio can talk HTTPS to Google's servers.

### Ensure connectivity

For this to work, Morio needs access to Google's servers on TCP port 443 (HTTPS).

### Create an app in the Google Cloud Console

#### Create the project for the app

In the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) create a new project.

#### Create the app itself

- Navigate to **APIs & Services** and click on **OAuth Consent Screen**
- Set the user type to:
  - **Internal** if your organisation uses Google as its provider for email and
    other services, and you want to limit access to people inside that
    organisation.
  - **External** if you want to allow anyone with a Google account to
    authenticate.

The **Edit App registration** view will load, allowing you to further complete
the configuration:

- Under **App Information**:
  - **App name**: This will be shown to the user, so make it meaningful.
    `Morio` is always a good idea.
  - **User support email**: Select your email address, or the email address
    your users should use for support.
- **App Logo**: You can upload a logo for the application. Might we suggest
  [the Morio logo](/img/morio-avatar.png)?
- Under **App Domain**:
  - Set **Application home page** to the base URL of your Morio instance or
    cluster. For example: `https://morio.my-company.com/`
  - Set **Application privacy policy** to the same URL unless you have a
    specific privacy policy URL.
  - Set **Application terms of service** to the same URL unless you have a
    specific terms of service URL.
- Under **Authorised domain** Add the top domain your Morio is hosted under.
  For example: `my-company.com`.
- Under **Developer contact information** enter your email address.

When everything is filled in, click the **Save and Continue** button.

#### Configure the scopes for the app

Now the **Scopes** screen will load.

- Click the **Add or Remove Scopes** button
- Select the `openid` scope and click **Update**

With the `openid` scope added to **Your non-sensitive scopes** click the **Save
and Continue** button.

#### Configure test users for your app

If this is a public app, your app will initially be published with a `testing`
status during which time only pre-defined users can use (or test) the app.

Click the **Add Users** button and add your own Google email, or those of other
users you want to be able to test that app.

#### Create an OAuth client ID

- Click on **Credentials** and then click the **Create Credentials** button,
  and select **OAuth Client ID** from the drop down menu.
- Under **Application Type** choose **Web application**
- Give it a **Name**. This name is for display in the console, it will not be
  shown to users. Use `morio` when you're not sure what to use.
- Under **Authorised redirect URIs**:
  - Enter `https://your-morio-fqdn/-/api/callback/oidc/google`
  where `your-morio-fqdn` is the _FQDN_ of your Morio instance, and `google` is
  the ID of the identity provider we will create below.
  - If you have more than 1 broker node, enter the URL for each node on its own
  line, and also add a line for a similar URL using the cluster _FQDN_.
  
Click the **Create** button to create the OAuth client ID.

Copy the **Client ID** and **Client secret** for use below.

<Note>

Your app is in test. You'll need to submit it for review when you have verified
everything is ok.

</Note>

### Create a new identity provider in Morio

Next, you need to add a new identity provider to Morio, specifically, [an
OpenID Connect identity provider](/docs/guides/settings/idps/#openid-connect).

Below is an example configuration:

```yaml
iam:
  providers:
    google: # You can choose the ID of the oidc provider instance
     provider: oidc # You cannot choose this, it must always be `oidc`
     label: Google
     about: Use your Google account to sign in to Morio
     issuer: https://accounts.google.com
     client_id: 26757689274-oa88vhi2m6jq5g4vr1sjoi4qc2a5in82.apps.googleusercontent.com
      client_secret: "{{{ GOOGLE_OIDC_SECRET }}}"
      username_field: email
      rbac:
        user:
          attribute: email
          regex: .
        engineer:
          attribute: email
          list:
            - mario@morio.it
            - luigi@morio.it
  ui:
    visibility:
      # Use 'tab' to show the identity provider 
      # as a tab on the login page
      google: tab
    order:
      google: 1
secrets:
  GOOGLE_OIDC_SECRET: "Your client secret here"
```
