[Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) can be integrated with Morio to act as an
identity provider with OpenID Connect.

If you have user accounts in a Keycloak instance that you want to use to
authenticate to Morio, you can do so by configuring [an OpenID Connect identity
provider](/docs/guides/settings/idps/#openid-connect) with Keycloak as the
backing OpenID provider.

To do so requires configuring a new application on Keycloak, and then using those
settings to set up a new identity provider in Morio. You also need to ensure
Morio can talk HTTPS to Keycloak.

### Ensure connectivity

For this to work, Morio needs access to your GitLab instance on TCP port 443
(HTTPS).

### Create a Keycloak client

What is often referred to as _an application_ in OpenID Connect is called
a `OpenID-Connect Client` in Keycloak. Clients in Keycloak are applications
or services that can request authentication of a user. So that's what we need.

Follow these steps to get started:

- Log in to Keycloak as an administrator
- On the navigation menu, select **Clients**
- Click the **Create client** button
- Under **General Settings**:
  - Set **Client type** to `OpenID Connect`
  - Set the **Client ID** box to `morio` as name for the client (or whatever you want)
  - Add a name and description if you like
  - Click the **Next** button
- Under **Capability config**:
  - Ensure **Client Authentication** is enabled
  - Make the **Authentication flow** is set to `Standard flow`
  - Click the **Next** button
- Under **Login settings**:
  - Set the **Root URL** to the URL of the Morio instance or cluster, for example, `https://<your instance fqdn>/`
  - Set the **Home URL** to the same
  - For **Valid redirect URLs**, use
   `https://your-morio-fqdn/-/api/callback/oidc/keycloak` where
   `your-morio-fqdn` is the _FQDN_ of your Morio instance, and `keycloak` is
   the ID of the identity provider we will create below. If you have more than
   1 broker node, enter the URL for each node on its own line, and also add a
   line for a similar URL using the cluster _FQDN_.
  - For **Web origins**, use `https://your-morio-fqdn/ where `your-morio-fqdn`
    is the _FQDN_ of your Morio instance.  If you have more than 1 broker node,
    enter the URL for each node on its own line, and also add a line for a
    similar URL using the cluster _FQDN_.
  - Click the **Save** button

After saving, you’ll be taken to the client’s settings page. Here, under the
**Settings** tab you can copy the client ID, whereas the client secret can be
found under the **Credentials** tab,

### Create a new identity provider in Morio

Next, you need to add a new identity provider to Morio, specifically, [an
OpenID Connect identity provider](/docs/guides/settings/idps/#openid-connect).

Below is an example configuration:

```yaml
iam:
  providers:
    keycloak: # You can choose the ID of the oidc provider instance
      provider: oidc # You cannot choose this, it must always be `oidc`
      label: Keycloak
      about: Use your Keycloakb account to sign in to Morio
      issuer: https://keycloak.morio.it
      client_id: morio-id-here
      client_secret: "{{{ KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_SECRET }}}"
      username_field: email
      rbac:
        user:
          attribute: email
          regex: .
        engineer:
          attribute: email
          list:
            - mario@morio.it
            - luigi@morio.it
  ui:
    visibility:
      # Use 'tab' to show the identity provider
      # as a tab on the login page
      keycloak: tab
    order:
      keycloak: 1
secrets:
  KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_SECRET: "Your Keycloak secret here"
```

<Tip>
Refer to [the Identity Providers Guide](/docs/guides/settings/idps/#openid-connect) and [the
reference documentation on the `iam`
settings](/docs/reference/settings/iam/#iamprovidersoidc-id) for more details.
