GitLab -- either [gitlab.com](https://gitlab.com/) or a self-hosted GitLab
instance -- can be integrated with Morio for two different purposes:

- [Preseeding Morio from GitLab](#preseeding-morio-from-gitlab)
- [GitLab as identity provider with OpenID
  Connect](#gitlab-as-identity-provider-with-openid-connect)

## Preseeding Morio from GitLab

When _preseeding_ Morio from GitLab, you have two choices:

- [Preseed Morio by cloning a GitLab repository](#preseed-morio-by-cloning-a-gitlab-repository)
- [Preseed Morio from the GitLab API](#preseed-morio-from-the-gitlab-api)

We recommend the _cloning a GitLab repository_ approach for most users.

### Preseed Morio by cloning a GitLab repository

<Tip>
This  way of preseeding is not specific to GitLab but works for any git hosting
provider that supports cloning over HTTPS.
</Tip>

If your repository is accessible without authentication, all you need is the HTTPS clone URL.
If not you also need to configure an access token so Morio can authenticate to be able to clone the repository.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="a" label="Without Authentication">

```yaml
git:
  gitlab:
    url: "https://gitlab.morio.it/path/to/my-repo.git"
preseed:
  base: "git:base.yaml@gitlab"
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="b" label="With Authentication">

```yaml
git:
  gitlab:
    url: "https://gitlab.morio.it/path/to/my-repo.git"
    token: "{{ GITLAB_TOKEN }}"
preseed:
  base: "git:base.yaml@gitlab"
secrets:
  GITLAB_TOKEN: "Your token here"
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
Refer to [the Preseeding Guide](/docs/guides/settings/preseed/) and [the
reference documentation on the `preseed`
settings](/docs/reference/settings/preseed/) for more details.
</Tip>

### Preseed Morio from the GitLab API

If your repository is very large and you only need one or a few files from it,
you can configure Morio to not clone the repository, but instead load specific
files from the GitLab API. This does always require authentication with an
access token.

```yaml
preseed:
  base: 
    gitlab:
      url: "https://gitlab.morio.it"
      project_id: 92332
      file_path: settings/production.yaml
      token: "{{ GITLAB_TOKEN }}"
secrets:
  GITLAB_TOKEN: "Your token here"
```

<Tip>
Refer to [the Preseeding Guide](/docs/guides/settings/preseed/) and [the
reference documentation on the `preseed`
settings](/docs/reference/settings/preseed/) for more details.
</Tip>

## GitLab as identity provider with OpenID Connect

If you have user accounts in a GitLab instance that you want to use to
authenticate to Morio, you can do so by configuring [an OpenID Connect identity
provider](/docs/guides/settings/idps/#openid-connect) with GitLab as the
backing OpenID provider.

To do so requires configuring a new application on GitLab, and then using those
settings to set up a new identity provider in Morio. You also need to ensure
Morio can talk HTTPS to GitLab.

### Ensure connectivity

For this to work, Morio needs access to your GitLab instance on TCP port 443
(HTTPS).

### Create a GitLab application

In the GitLab web interface, navigate to **Applications** under **User
settings**, or use this relative URL: `/-/user_settings/applications`.

Click the **Add new application** button and fill in the fields:

- **Name**: Can be anything, but users will be presented this name when asking
  for consent, so make it meaningful. `Morio` is a good default.
- **Redirect URL**: Use `https://your-morio-fqdn/-/api/callback/oidc/gitlab`
  where `your-morio-fqdn` is the _FQDN_ of your Morio instance, and `gitlab` is
  the ID of the identity provider we will create below.
- If you have more than 1 broker node, enter the URL for each node on its own
  line, and also add a line for a similar URL using the cluster _FQDN_.
- **Confidential**: Tick the confidential box as the client secret will not be
  available in the Morio UI. (Despite that, Morio uses _PKCE_).
- **Scopes**: Select `openid`, `profile`, and `email`

When you are done, click the **Save Application** button. The page will reload
and present you with the **Application ID** and **Secret**.  This is the only
time you will get to see the secret, so make sure to copy it, along with the
apllication ID.

### Create a new identity provider in Morio

Next, you need to add a new identity provider to Morio, specifically, [an
OpenID Connect identity provider](/docs/guides/settings/idps/#openid-connect).

Below is an example configuration:

```yaml
iam:
  providers:
    gitlab: # You can choose the ID of the oidc provider instance
      provider: oidc # You cannot choose this, it must always be `oidc`
      label: GitLab
      about: Use your GitLab account to sign in to Morio
      issuer: https://git.morio.it
      client_id: 9f8afda548c112e70323ff60ff3d080b3216c691a05e69ca8b08e146085adf27
      client_secret: "{{{ GITLAB_OIDC_SECRET }}}"
      username_field: email
      rbac:
        user:
          attribute: email
          regex: .
        engineer:
          attribute: email
          list:
            - mario@morio.it
            - luigi@morio.it
  ui:
    visibility:
      # Use 'tab' to show the identity provider
      # as a tab on the login page
      gitlab: tab
    order:
      gitlab: 1
secrets:
  GITLAB_OIDC_SECRET: "Your GitLab secret here"
```

<Tip>
Refer to [the Idenity Providers Guide](/docs/guides/settings/idps/#openid-connect) and [the
reference documentation on the `iam`
settings](/docs/reference/settings/iam/#iamprovidersoidc-id) for more details.
