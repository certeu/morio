GitHub can be used for _preseeding_ the Morio configuration. 

<Note>
Unlike
[GitLab](/docs/guides/settings/integrations/gitlab/), GitHub cannot be
used for authentication as GitHub does not support OpenID Connect.
</Note>

## Preseeding Morio from GitHub

When _preseeding_ Morio from GitHub, you have two choices:

- [Preseed Morio by cloning a GitHub
  repository](#preseed-morio-by-cloning-a-github-repository)
- [Preseed Morio from the GitHub API](#preseed-morio-from-the-github-api)

We recommend the _cloning a GitHub repository_ approach for most users.

### Preseed Morio by cloning a GitHub repository

<Tip>
This  way of preseeding is not specific to GitHub but works for any git hosting
provider that supports cloning over HTTPS.
</Tip>

If your repository is accessible without authentication, all you need is the
HTTPS clone URL.  If not you also need to configure an access token so Morio
can authenticate to be able to clone the repository.

<TabItem value="a" label="Without Authentication">

```yaml
git:
  github:
    url: "https://github.com/certeu/morio.git"
preseed:
  base: "git:base.yaml@github"
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="b" label="With Authentication">

```yaml
git:
  github:
    url: "https://github.com/certeu/morio.git"
    token: "{{ GITHUB_TOKEN }}"
preseed:
  base: "git:base.yaml@github"
secrets:
  GITHUB_TOKEN: "Your token here"
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
Refer to [the Preseeding Guide](/docs/guides/settings/preseed/) and [the
reference documentation on the `preseed`
settings](/docs/reference/settings/preseed/) for more details.
</Tip>

### Preseed Morio from the GitHub API

If your repository is very large and you only need one or a few files from it,
you can configure Morio to not clone the repository, but instead load specific
files from the GitHub API. This does always require authentication with an
access token.

```yaml
preseed:
  base: 
    github:
      url: "https://github.morio.it"
      owner: certeu
      project: morio
      file_path: settings/production.yaml
      token: "{{ GITHUB_TOKEN }}"
secrets:
  GITHUB_TOKEN: "Your token here"
```

<Tip>
Refer to [the Preseeding Guide](/docs/guides/settings/preseed/) and [the
reference documentation on the `preseed`
settings](/docs/reference/settings/preseed/) for more details.
