title: Preseeding Guide
---

To _preseed_ the Morio config means to load it from an external source, rather
than keep it within Morio itself.

This guide covers the general principle and best practices. For details about
all possibilities, refer to [the reference documentation on the `preseed`
settings](/docs/reference/settings/preseed/).

## General principle and origin story

At CERT-EU we like to keep our configurations under version control.
There are [so many reasons](/docs/training/git/) for this that we consider
it common sense, and we have added the preseeding functionality to Morio
so we could keep its settings in git too.

We also run several different Morio instances. We have a production instance,
a staging instance, and a bunch of development instances that come and go as
we work on or test out new features.

Often, a variety of settings are the same between these different instances and
maintaining the same info in multiple places is error-prone, and no fun.

This is why we implemented the idea of the _base settings_ and one or more _overlays_.
This allows you to create a modular Morio configuration.

We'll typically store the node info in the base settings, and this would be
different for every environment. Then, we add overlays like various identity
providers, internal certificates that should be trusted and so on.

Obviously, you know best what works in your environment. But understanding the
reasons behind these preseeding settings will hopefully help you make the most
of this powerful feature.

## Understanding overlays

The base settings file is just that: The base on which we will construct our final settings object.

An overlay then is a file that will _mutate_ the base settings.
Typically by adding settings, but an overlay can also overwrite settings.

To understand this process, we will use an example with fictional values.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="a" label="base.yaml" default>

The base settings file, whether it's provided as YAML or JSON will be
converted to a JavaScript object that will form the basis of our settings.

```yaml title="Provided YAML base"
key1: value1
key2:
  subkey1: subvalue 1
  subkey2:
    subsubkey1: subsubvalue 1
```

```js title="The resulting Javascript object"
{
  key1: "value1"
  key2: {
    subkey1: "subvalue 1",
    subkey2: {
      subsubkey1: "subsubvalue 1"
    }
  }
}
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="b" label="overlay1.yaml" default>

An overlay file holds key/value pairs. The key determines the **target** in dot-notation,
and the value holds, well, the value.

```yaml title="Provided YAML overlay"
key1: different value 1
key2.subkey2.subsubkey2: I am new
key3: So am I:
```

You can read an overlay as a series of mutations:

- Set `key1` to `different value 1`
- Set `key2.subkey2.subsubkey2` to `I am new`
- Set `key3` to `So am I`

Which results in:

```js title="The resulting Javascript object"
{
  key1: "different value 1"
  key2: {
    subkey1: "subvalue 1",
    subkey2: {
      subsubkey1: "subsubvalue 1"
      subsubkey2: "I am new"
    }
  },
  key3: "So am I"
}
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="c" label="overlay2.json" default>

Whether you use YAML or JSON does not matter.

```json title="Provided JSON overlay"
{
  "key1": "different again",
  "key2.whatever": {
    "values": {
      "can": {
        "be any": {
          "type": ["of course"]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Overlays are applied one after the other, so the end result is:

```js title="The resulting Javascript object"
{
  key1: "different again"
  key2: {
    subkey1: "subvalue 1",
    subkey2: {
      subsubkey1: "subsubvalue 1"
      subsubkey2: "I am new"
    },
    whatever: {
      values: {
        can: {
          "be any": {
            type: [ "of course" ]
          }
        }
      }
    }
  },
  key3: "So am I"
}
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Overlay limitations

Because of the ways overlays use dot-notation to make changes to the settings object, there are two limitations to be aware of:

- Working with array is difficult. You cannot easily add something to an array.
  This is why in general in Morio we avoid using arrays for settings.
- You cannot _remove_ settings. While you can overwrite them, and set them to
  something falsy or `null`, you cannot remove them. Which is why it is best to
  keep your base settings to the strict minimum.

## Recommended setup using a git repository

We recommend placing your Morio settings and overlays for one or more different
environments in a single repository and then let Morio clone this repository
and reference files from it.

Let's walk through this example step by step.

### Initial setup

When we initially setup a Morio instance, there is no Vault integration, nor
can we use encrypted secrets as there is no key pair yet.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="a" label="Without authentication" default>

If the git repository you are using **does not** require authentication, you can
use an example like this:

```json title="Minimal JSON preseed settings"
{
  "git": {
    "repo":
      "url": "https://git.morio.it/iac/morio.git",
      "ref": "main"
    }
  }
  "base": "git:base.yaml@repo"
}
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="b" label="With Authentication">

If the git repository you are using **does** require authentication, you can
use an example like this:

```json title="Minimal JSON preseed settings"
{
  "git": {
    "repo":
      "url": "https://git.morio.it/iac/morio.git",
      "ref": "main",
      "token": "your-short-lived-token-here"
    }
  }
  "base": "git:base.yaml@repo"
}
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

If you save this as `preseed.json` we can set up Morio with this curl command:

```sh
curl -k -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d@preseed.json https://example.morio.it/-/api/preseed
```

This will be sufficient to bootstrap Morio, assuming
`base.yaml` in the repository holds valid settings.

### Example base settings file

On initial setup, we need to provide Morio with our preseed settings.
But once Morio is deployed, they are part of our regular settings.
Which means that they can be provided by the base file or an overlay.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="a" label="Base settings" default>

Our base settings holds the minimal settings: Our cluster nodes and name.

```yaml
cluster:
  broker_nodes:
    - broker.morio.it
  name: Just an example
```

</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="a2" label="Preseed Overlay" default>

We've places our preseed setting in an overlay and made some changes:

- The preseed settings are now under the `preseed` key
- We've added our overlays, for which we used a glob pattern
- We're now using a secret to hold our `GIT_TOKEN`

```yaml
preseed:
  git:
    repo:
      url: 'https://git.morio.it/iac/morio.git'
      ref: main
      token: '{{ GIT_TOKEN }}'
  base: git:base-settings/my-instance.yaml@repo
  overlays: git:overlays/*.yaml
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="b" label="IDP Overlay">

This is another example, it adds and identity provider.

```yaml
iam.providers.ad:
  provider: ldap
  about: This is your Active Directory account, the same you use to login to your computer.
  server:
    url: "ldaps://dc1.tokyo.morio.it
    bindDN: "CN=morio-ldap,OU=Users,DC=tokyo,DC=morio,DC=it",
    bindCredentials: "{{{ AD_PASSWORD }}}",
    searchBase: "OU=Users-EU,DC=tokyo,DC=morio,DC=it",
    searchFilter: "(&(objectClass=user)(samaccountname={{username}}))"
  username_field: samaccountname
  label: Active Directory
  rbac:
    user:
      attribute: samaccountname
      regex: .
    engineer:
      attribute: samaccountname
      list:
        - jdecock
        - lbazille
        - stellene
```

  </TabItem>
<TabItem value="c" label="Secrets overlay">

If you do not have Hashicorp Vault or OpenBao available, you can pre-encrypt your secrets via the Morio API or UI.
Then, you can safely commit them to git:

```yaml
secrets:
  GIT_TOKEN: '{ iv: "9989922c677e1d4d0f9a9d1556ac7e7d", ct: "4e3fafac2f4febb1c40b7cced3ddcd21" }'
```

  </TabItem>
<TabItem value="d" label="Overlay using Vault">

If you have Hashicorp Vault or OpenBao available, you can defer to it for secrets storage:

```yaml
secrets:
  AD_PASSWORD:
    vault: "morio:AD_PASSWORD"

vault:
url: https://vault.morio.it

```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Alternative preseed sources

In the example above, we cloned a git repository and then loaded files from it for our base settings and overlays.

That is a common scenario that comes warmly recommended, but there are other sources you can use.

### Preseed from a URL

You can preseed from a URL, both the base settings or one or more overlays.
This is useful for simple scenarios and quick tests.

Refer to [the `preseed` settings reference documentation](/docs/reference/settings/preseed/) for all details.

### Preseed from the GitHub API

If your repository is very large, cloning it in its entirety to be able to load a few files might be overkill.
In that case, you can configure Morio to fetch specific files from the GitHub API.

Refer to [the `preseed` settings reference documentation](/docs/reference/settings/preseed/) for all details.

### Preseed from the GitLab API

If your repository is very large, cloning it in its entirety to be able to load a few files might be overkill.
In that case, you can configure Morio to fetch specific files from the GitLab API.

Refer to [the `preseed` settings reference documentation](/docs/reference/settings/preseed/) for all details.
