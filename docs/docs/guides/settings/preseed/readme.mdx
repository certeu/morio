title: Preseeding Guide
---

To _preseed_ the Morio config means to load it from an external source -- 
typically a Git repository -- rather than keep it within Morio itself.
This allows you to deploy Morio with an _infrastructure as code_ approach.

This guide covers the general principle and best practices. For details about
all possibilities, refer to [the reference documentation on the `preseed`
settings](/docs/reference/settings/preseed/).

## Preseeding and reseeding

Any time you update Morio settings, those settings can be preseeded.
But some data -- in particular preseeding key data -- can only be
provided at the initial setup of Morio.

Other changes can be made later, and when we update Morio settings
by reloading them from a remote system as defined in the preseed
settings, we call this __reseeding__.

So preseeding is the general principle of keeping your settings outside
of Morio, whereas reseeding is the process of reloading Morio and 
apply the preseeded settings.

## Preseeding settings

How Morio should go and get your data is determined by the
`preseed` settings. Refer to [the reference documentation of the 
`preseed` settings](/docs/reference/settings/preseed/) for all details, 
but in general this defines a Git repository that Morio should use
as the source of truth for its settings.

Morio will load the base settings and then apply [any overlays you have 
defined](#overlays).

## Preseeding key data

At the initial setup of Morio -- and only at the initial setup -- you
have the option to preseed Morio's key data.

To do so, you should first [export the key
data](/docs/reference/apis/api/#tag/export/operation/exportKeys) from an
existing Morio instance, then add it under `preseed.keys`.

<Note>
This is an advanced feature to facilitate blue/green deployments
or other use cases. You can safely ignore this.
</Note>

## Base settings and overlays {#overlays}

The base settings file is just that: the base on which we will construct our
final settings object.

An overlay then is a file that will _mutate_ the base settings.
Typically it is done by adding settings, but an overlay can also overwrite settings.

To understand this process, we will use an example with fictional values.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="a" label="base.yaml" default>

The base settings file, whether it's provided as YAML or JSON, will be
converted to a JavaScript object that will form the basis of our settings.

```yaml title="Provided YAML base"
key1: value1
key2:
  subkey1: subvalue 1
  subkey2:
    subsubkey1: subsubvalue 1
```

```js title="The resulting Javascript object"
{
  key1: "value1"
  key2: {
    subkey1: "subvalue 1",
    subkey2: {
      subsubkey1: "subsubvalue 1"
    }
  }
}
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="b" label="overlay1.yaml" default>

An overlay file holds key/value pairs. The key determines the **target** in dot-notation,
and the value holds, well, the value.

```yaml title="Provided YAML overlay"
key1: different value 1
key2.subkey2.subsubkey2: I am new
key3: So am I
```

You can read an overlay as a series of mutations:

- Set `key1` to `different value 1`
- Set `key2.subkey2.subsubkey2` to `I am new`
- Set `key3` to `So am I`

Which results in:

```js title="The resulting Javascript object"
{
  key1: "different value 1"
  key2: {
    subkey1: "subvalue 1",
    subkey2: {
      subsubkey1: "subsubvalue 1"
      subsubkey2: "I am new"
    }
  },
  key3: "So am I"
}
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="c" label="overlay2.json" default>

Whether you use YAML or JSON does not matter.

```json title="Provided JSON overlay"
{
  "key1": "different again",
  "key2.whatever": {
    "values": {
      "can": {
        "be any": {
          "type": ["of course"]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Overlays are applied one after the other, so the end result is:

```js title="The resulting Javascript object"
{
  key1: "different again"
  key2: {
    subkey1: "subvalue 1",
    subkey2: {
      subsubkey1: "subsubvalue 1"
      subsubkey2: "I am new"
    },
    whatever: {
      values: {
        can: {
          "be any": {
            type: [ "of course" ]
          }
        }
      }
    }
  },
  key3: "So am I"
}
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Overlay limitations

Because of the ways overlays use dot-notation to make changes to the settings object, there are two limitations to be aware of:

- Working with arrays is difficult. You cannot easily add something to an array.
  This is why in general in Morio we avoid using arrays for settings.
- You cannot _remove_ settings. While you can overwrite them, and set them to
  something falsy or `null`, you cannot remove them, which is why it is best to
  keep your base settings to the strict minimum.

## Example setup using a Git repository {#example}

We recommend placing your Morio settings and overlays for one or more different
environments in a single repository, then let Morio clone this repository
and reference files from it.

Let's walk through an example step by step.

### Initial setup

When we initially setup a Morio instance, there is no Vault integration, nor
can we use encrypted secrets as there is no key pair yet.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="a" label="Without authentication" default>

If the git repository you are using **does not** require authentication, you can
use an example like this:

```json title="Minimal JSON preseed settings"
{
  "git": {
    "repo":
      "url": "https://git.morio.it/iac/morio.git",
      "ref": "main"
    }
  }
  "base": "git:base.yaml@repo"
}
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="b" label="With authentication">

If the git repository you are using **does** require authentication, you can
use an example like this:

```json title="Minimal JSON preseed settings"
{
  "git": {
    "repo":
      "url": "https://git.morio.it/iac/morio.git",
      "ref": "main",
      "token": "your-short-lived-token-here"
    }
  }
  "base": "git:base.yaml@repo"
}
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

If you save this as `preseed.json` we can set up Morio with this curl command:

```sh
curl -k -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d@preseed.json https://example.morio.it/-/api/preseed
```

This is sufficient to bootstrap Morio, assuming that
`base.yaml` in the repository holds valid settings.

### Example base settings file

On initial setup, we need to provide Morio with our preseed settings - 
but once Morio is deployed, they become a part of our regular settings,
which means that they can be provided by the base file or by an overlay.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="a" label="Base settings" default>

Our base settings holds the minimal settings: our cluster nodes and name.

```yaml
cluster:
  broker_nodes:
    - broker.morio.it
  name: Just an example
```

</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="a2" label="Preseed Overlay" default>

We've placed our preseed settings in an overlay and made some changes:

- The preseed settings are now under the `preseed` key
- We've added our overlays, for which we used a glob pattern
- We're now using a secret to hold our `GIT_TOKEN`

```yaml
preseed:
  git:
    repo:
      url: 'https://git.morio.it/iac/morio.git'
      ref: main
      token: '{{ GIT_TOKEN }}'
  base: git:base-settings/my-instance.yaml@repo
  overlays: git:overlays/*.yaml
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="b" label="IDP Overlay">

This is another example, it adds an identity provider.

```yaml
iam.providers.ad:
  provider: ldap
  about: This is your Active Directory account, the same you use to login to your computer.
  server:
    url: "ldaps://dc1.tokyo.morio.it
    bindDN: "CN=morio-ldap,OU=Users,DC=tokyo,DC=morio,DC=it",
    bindCredentials: "{{{ AD_PASSWORD }}}",
    searchBase: "OU=Users-EU,DC=tokyo,DC=morio,DC=it",
    searchFilter: "(&(objectClass=user)(samaccountname={{username}}))"
  username_field: samaccountname
  label: Active Directory
  rbac:
    user:
      attribute: samaccountname
      regex: .
    engineer:
      attribute: samaccountname
      list:
        - mario
        - luigi
```

  </TabItem>
<TabItem value="c" label="Secrets overlay">

If you do not have Hashicorp Vault or OpenBao available, you can pre-encrypt your secrets via the Morio API or UI.
Then, you can safely commit them to git:

```yaml
secrets:
  GIT_TOKEN: '{ iv: "9989922c677e1d4d0f9a9d1556ac7e7d", ct: "4e3fafac2f4febb1c40b7cced3ddcd21" }'
```

  </TabItem>
<TabItem value="d" label="Overlay using Vault">

If you have Hashicorp Vault or OpenBao available, you can defer to it for secrets storage:

```yaml
secrets:
  AD_PASSWORD:
    vault: "morio:AD_PASSWORD"

vault:
  url: https://vault.morio.it

```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Alternative preseed sources

In the example above, we cloned a git repository, then loaded files from it for our base settings and overlays.

That is a common scenario that comes warmly recommended, but there are other sources you can use.

### Preseed from a URL

You can preseed both the base settings and one or more overlays from a URL.
This is useful for simple scenarios and quick tests.

Refer to [the `preseed` settings reference documentation](/docs/reference/settings/preseed/) for all details.

### Preseed from the GitHub API

If your repository is very large, cloning it in its entirety just to load a few files might be overkill.
In that case, you can configure Morio to fetch specific files from the GitHub API.

Refer to [the `preseed` settings reference documentation](/docs/reference/settings/preseed/) for all details.

### Preseed from the GitLab API

If your repository is very large, cloning it in its entirety just to load a few files might be overkill.
In that case, you can configure Morio to fetch specific files from the GitLab API.

Refer to [the `preseed` settings reference documentation](/docs/reference/settings/preseed/) for all details.
