title: Morio Installation Guide
---

This guide covers the various ways you can install Morio, from fully automated,
to completely manual.

When we say _install Morio_ we mean install `moriod`, the Morio distribution
that sets up a Morio node.

## Fully automated

To install a Morio node, run this command as a user with `sudo` permissions:

```sh
curl https://install.morio.it/ | bash
```

This will run through the following steps:

- [Ensure `systemd` is available](#ensure-systemd-is-available)
- [Detect the package type](#determine-the-package-type)
- [Download and install the `moriod-repo` package](#download-and-install-the-moriod-repo-package)
- [Update the list of available software](##update-the-list-of-available-sofware)
- [Install the `moriod` package](#install-the-moriod-package)

Alternatively, you can run all of these steps manually, as outlined below.

## Manual using our packages

To install manually, we will go through the same steps as the install script:

- [Ensure `systemd` is available](#ensure-systemd-is-available)
- [Detect the package type](#determine-the-package-type)
- [Download the `moriod-repo` package](#download-the-moriod-repo-package)
- [Update the list of available software](##update-the-list-of-available-sofware)
- [Install the `moriod` package](#install-the-moriod-package)

### Ensure `systemd` is available

To install Morio using our packages, `systemd` is a dependency.

Make sure your system has `systemd` by running:

```sh
systemctl -h
```

If you get a bunch of output on how to use `systemctl`, you have `systemd`.

<Tip>

If you do not have `systemd` on your system, you can still do [a fully manual
install of Morio](#fully-manual).

</Tip>

### Determine the package type

We provide `.deb` packages for APT-based systems, like Debian or Ubuntu, as well as `.rpm` packages for RPM-based systems like RedHat, RockyLinux, or Fedora.

```sh
apt -h
```

If you get a bunch of output about the `apt` packages manager, you are on an APT-based system.
If not, you are probably on an RPM-based system.

### Download and install the `moriod-repo` package

Download the `moriod-repo` package, and then install it:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="deb" label="On APT-based systems">

```sh
curl https://apt.repo.morio.it/setup-moriod-repo.deb -o ./setup-moriod-repo.deb
sudo apt install -y ./setup-moriod-repo.deb
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="rpm" label="On RPM-based systems">

```sh
curl https://rpm.repo.morio.it/setup-moriod-repo.rpm -o ./setup-moriod-repo.rpm
sudo yum install -y ./setup-moriod-repo.rpm
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The first line downloads the package, from these URLS:

- For APT-based systems: https://apt.repo.morio.it/setup-moriod-repo.deb
- For RPM-based systems: https://rpm.repo.morio.it/setup-moriod-repo.rpm

The second line installs it.

### Update the list of available software

The `moriod-repo` package we just install adds a new software repository.
Before we can install software from it, we need to update the list of available packages:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="deb" label="On APT-based systems">

```sh
sudo apt update
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="rpm" label="On RPM-based systems">

```sh
sudo yum clean expire-cache
sudo yum check-update
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


### Install the `moriod` package

Now we can install the `moriod` package:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="deb" label="On APT-based systems">

```sh
sudo apt install -y moriod
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="rpm" label="On RPM-based systems">

```sh
sudo yum install -y moriod
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This will create a new systemd service that will start Morio.

## Fully manual

For a fully manual install of Morio, we are going to create the Morio service
by hand, as adjust some of its configuration.

<Fixme>Explain this in more detail</Fixme>

You can use the example below as-is, or update it according to your needs:

```sh
docker run --rm \
  --name=core \
  --hostname=core \
  --network=morionet \
  --network-alias=core \
  --init \
  -v "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock" \
  -v "/etc/morio:/etc/morio" \
  -v "/usr/share/morio:/morio/data" \
  -v "/var/log/morio:/var/log/morio" \
  -e "MORIO_CORE_LOG_LEVEL=warn \
  -e "NODE_ENV=production" \
  itsmorio/core:latest
```

When the service is stopped, we recommend running:

```
docker rm -f api ui proxy
```

If not, the Morio UI and API will remain up, but won't function properly.
