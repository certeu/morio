The `api` service provides the __Morio Management API__, or __API__ for short.

Morio utilized an API-first approach, so anything that can be managed about
your Morio setup can be managed through its API.

This is an HTTP REST API that implements [the OpenAPI v3
specification](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html).
The API itself includes the API reference documentation, available at `/-/api/docs`.

<Note>
The API service is available in epehemeral mode.

<Fixme>

Include API docs here when [this plugin](https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/docusaurus-openapi-docs) supports Docusaurus v3.
