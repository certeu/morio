The `api` service provides the __Morio Management API__, or __API__ for short.

Morio utilized an API-first approach, so anything that can be managed about
your Morio setup can be managed through its API.

This is an HTTP REST API that implements [the OpenAPI v3
specification](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html).
The API itself includes the API reference documentation, available at `/-/api/docs`.

<Note>
This service __is available__ in [ephemeral state](/docs/reference/terminology/ephemeral-state/)
