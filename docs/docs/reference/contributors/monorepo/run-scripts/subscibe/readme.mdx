title: subscribe

The `subscribe` _run script_ will start a Kafka client and setup a 
consumer for the topic you pass it as the first argument.
It also takes a second optional argument `pretty` that will 
pretty-print the output. 

Run `npm run subscribe topic-name` in the _monorepo_ root to 
trigger this script, or `npm run subscribe topic-name pretty` to
run this with pretty-printed output..

Under the hood, this will run:

```sh title="Terminal"
node scripts/kafka-client.mjs
```

This script will read the Morio root token from disk and use it to
request an X509 certificate from the API. It will then use that 
certificate to authenticate with mTLS.
