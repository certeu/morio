title: check
---

The `check` _run script_ runs the [aspell](http://aspell.net/)
spell checker on a single file from the documentation that you
should pass it.

Run `npm run check docs/docs/.../readme.mdx` in the _monorepo_ 
root to trigger this script, making sure to provide the full path
to the file as argument.

This is an interactive script, the spell checker will promptly you what to
do when an issue is found. If you instruct it to, it will make changes
to the documentation to fix the found issues. It will not make backup
files as aspell does by default.

The spell checker will also check lines marked to be skipped, so you
can ignore any issues found on those.

Under the hood, this will run:

```sh title="Terminal"
./scripts/check-doc.sh
```

## Prerequisites

This relies on the [aspell](http://aspell.net/) package being available.
