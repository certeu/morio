title: build:moriod-repo-deb
---

The `build:moriod-repo-deb` _run script_ builds a Debian package (`.deb)
that adds the morio APT repository to the system, as well as its public key
to verify signatures.

Run `npm run build:moriod-repo-deb` in the _monorepo_ root to trigger this script.

Under the hood, this will run:

```sh title="Terminal"
./scripts/build-repo-deb.sh
```

This launches the `dbuilder` container, so make sure to run [the
`build:dbuilder` run
script](/docs/reference/contributors/monorepo/run-scripts/build-dbuilder/)
first if that container is not yet available locally.
