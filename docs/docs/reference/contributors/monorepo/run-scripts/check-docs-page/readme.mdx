title: check-docs-page
---

The `check-docs-page` _run script_ takes the path to a `.md` file as
argument, and for this file will verify a `title` key is set in front
matter, and then run the [aspell](http://aspell.net/) spell checker
on that page.

It is a way to run check on particular page for issues, rather than
having to run `npm run ci:spellcheck` to verify all documentation.

The `cdp` run script is a alias for `check-docs-page` created for
convenience, as it is is easier and faster to type.

Under the hood, this will run:

```sh title="Terminal"
./scripts/check-docs-page.sh
```

## Prerequisites

This relies on the [aspell](http://aspell.net/) package being available.
