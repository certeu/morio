The `pull-oci` _run script_ will pull all Docker images that are used 
by Morio.

Typically, Morio core will pull images are required. However, this can
significantly slow down startup, and won't work [when working on Morio without
a network
connection](/docs/guides/contributors/monorepo/#pre-pull-docker-images).

This script lets you pre-pull all images so they are available locally.

Run `npm run pull-oci` in the _monorepo_ root to trigger this script.

Under the hood, this will run:

```sh title="Terminal"
./scripts/pull-oci-images.sh
```

That script is itself auto-generated by [the `reconfigure` run
script](/docs/reference/contributors/monorepo/run-scripts/reconfigure/).

<Tip>
#### This run script is idempotent

It is safe to run this script more than once without compounding effects.
