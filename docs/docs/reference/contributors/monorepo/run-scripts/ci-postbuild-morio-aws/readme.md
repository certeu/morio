The `ci:postbuild.morio.aws` _run script_ marks Morio AMI images as public,
and will update the list of published images in the _monorepo_. It will not
do so directly, but instead create a pull request.

Run `npm run ci:postbuild.morio.aws` in the _monorepo_ root to trigger this script.

Under the hood, this will run:

```sh title="Terminal"
./scripts/ci-postbuild-morio-aws.sh
```

## Prerequisites

This script typically runs in CI, but it can be ran locally as long as you make
sure that the GitHub cli and AWS cli is available.

In addition, the following environment variables should be set:

|                    Name | Description                         |
| ----------------------: | ----------------------------------- |
|     `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | The key ID for access to [AWS][aws] |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | The secret for access to [AWS][aws] |

This will pull the list of AMI images tagged `morio=true` and make them public.
