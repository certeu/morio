title: rev

The `rev` _run script_ will prompt for a new version number and apply
that to the _monorepo_.

Run `npm run rev` in the _monorepo_ root to trigger this script.

Under the hood, this will run:

```sh title="Terminal"
npm run reversion
```

In other words `npm run rev` is an alias of `npm run reversion`.
See [build:dev](/docs/reference/contributors/monorepo/run-scripts/reversion).
