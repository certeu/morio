title: packer:build
---

The `packer:build` _run script_ builds image for
all [Hashicorp Packer](https://packer.io/) configurations.

Run `npm run packer:build` in the _monorepo_ root to trigger this script.

Under the hood, this will run:

```sh title="Terminal"
packer build packer
```

As such, it will run packer for all configurations stored in
the <RepoFile>packer</RepoFile> folder of the _monorepo_.
