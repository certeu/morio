title: "lint:api-spec" # skip-spellcheck
---

The `lint:api-check` _run script_ will submit the _API service_ OpenAPI
specification file to 
the [RateMyOpenAPI.com](https://ratemyopenapi.com) <!-- skip-spellcheck -->
API for an overall score.

If the score is below 95, that will be considered a failure.

Run `npm run lint:api-spec` in the _monorepo_ root to trigger this script.

Under the hood, this will run:

```sh title="Terminal"
./scripts/lint-api-spec.sh
```

## Prerequisites

This requires an API key 
for [RateMyOpenAPI.com](https://ratemyopenapi.com), <!-- skip-spellcheck -->
but they are free.
