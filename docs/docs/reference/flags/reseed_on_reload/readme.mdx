Enable this flag to _reseed_ Morio when reloading.

This flag comes into play when you have have `preseed.git` settings that make
Morio clone a git repository locally. This gives you various ways to keep your
configuration under version control, as outlined in [the Preseeding 
Guide](/docs/reference/settings/preseed/).

By default, Morio will not re-clone the repository when you make a
configuration change, or when you restart Morio. Instead, it will only update
the git repository from the remote when you explicitly reseed Morio through
[the `reseed` API
endpoint](/docs/reference/apis/api/#tag/settings/operation/reseed), (or via the
UI which uses this endpoint under the hood).

When you enable this flag, Morio will reseed (thus update the local git content
from the remote) whenever you restart it, or update it's configuration.

<Warning>
Even with this flag enabled, Morio will not reseed the data when it restarts
in an unforeseen way, such as a server reboot.
</Warning>

<Note>
#### Understanding then this flag takes effect

When updating the Morio settings, there are three steps:

- Core receives the configuration update request
- Core will reseed if the `RESEED_ON_RELOAD` flag is set
- Core will apply the new configuration

This means that if you change this flag in an update to the settings, it will
not take effect until the next update.

In other words, the flag value of the **running configuration&& is used, not of
the **new settings**.
