title: Feature Flags
---

Feature flags -- or Flags for short -- allow you to enable or disable certain
features inside Morio.

Note that all flags are disabled by default, so you can only ever _enable_ flags, even if that flag disables something.

For example, to **disable** the UI service, you can **enable** the `HEADLESS_MORIO` flag.


The full list of feature flags is included below:
