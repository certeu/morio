title: Broker Node
---

A __broker node__ is any Morio node that provides [the broker service](/docs/guides/services/broker).

A node in a Morio deployment can have two different roles, broker node, or [flanking node](/docs/reference/terminology/flanking-node).  
As you may have guessed, a flanking node is a node that does not provide the broker service.
