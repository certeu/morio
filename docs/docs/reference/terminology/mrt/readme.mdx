The **Morio root token** or **mrt** is a token generated during the initial
Morio setup that grants you root access.

It is the only way to authenticate to Morio before any _identity providers_
have been configured.

Once identity providers have been configured, you can disable authentication
with the root token via [the `DISABLE_IDP_MRT` feature
flag](/docs/reference/flags/disable_idp_mrt/)..
