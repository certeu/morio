In Morio _preseeding_ refers to sourcing the Morio settings from an external
system, rather than keeping them in Morio itself.

This can be used both at the initial setup of Morio -- the origin of the term
_preseeding_ -- and throughout the lifecycle of your Morio deployment.

We recommend keeping your configuration in git, and preseeding it from there.
