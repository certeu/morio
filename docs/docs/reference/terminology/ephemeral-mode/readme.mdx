title: Ephemeral Mode
---

Before a Morio node receives its initial _settings_, it will run in an ephemeral
mode, where it does nothing but eagerly await its setup.

To bring a node out of its ephemeral mode, you need to provide initial
_settings_.
You can use the setup wizard of the ui service to do so, or use the API service
directly.
