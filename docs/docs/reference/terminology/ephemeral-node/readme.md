title: Ephemeral Node
---

Before a Morio node receives its initial settings, it will run in an ephemeral
state, where it does nothing but eagerly await its setup.

To bring a node out of its ephemeral state, you need to provide initial
settings.
You can use the setup wizard of the ui service to do so, or use the API service
directly.
