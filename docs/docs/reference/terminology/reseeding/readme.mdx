Reseeding, also referred to as a _reseeding event_ is the process of asking
Morio to reload its configuration based on the _preseed_ settings.

It is typically used by teams practising infrastructure-as-code or gitops.

We highly recommend storing your Morio settings under version control and using
reseeding to update Morio. Refer to [the preseeding
guide](/docs/guides/settings/preseed) for more info.
