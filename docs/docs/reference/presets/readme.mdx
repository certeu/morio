Morio presets are used to keep our code _DRY_. In other words, they are values
that are set in a central location, and then re-used in various parts of the
code.

<Warning>

#### Thread carefully
Some presets cannot be changed without breaking things.
Others can be changed, but it's still not recommended.
Refer to the preset's documentation to learn whether it is 
<Label style="success">Save</Label> or <Label style="danger">Not Save</Label>
to change the default value of a preset.
