Today we are delighted to introduce [Morio](https://github.com/certeu/morio),
an end-to-end streaming data backbone designed to meet your observability
needs. Morio will simplify the setup and management of a robust observability
infrastructure, leveraging top-tier open-source technologies.

Morio is currently **early-access alpha code**. We are building this in the
open, so feel free to look around, try it out, and [leave
feedback](https://github.com/certeu/morio/discussions).

With Morio, you will be able to effortlessly collect, analyse, and act on data
from various endpoints, ensuring seamless data flow and comprehensive
monitoring. Under the hood, Morio utilises:

- [RedPanda](https://redpanda.com/) for its Kafka-compatible streaming API
- [SmallStep Step-CA](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-ca/) for X.509
  certificate provisioning and mTLS authentication
- [Beats](https://www.elastic.co/beats) and
  [Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/logstash) from
  [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/) for collecting/shipping and routing data
  respectively
- and [Traefik](https://traefik.io/traefik/) as the entry point proxy for all
  HTTP-based services.

While anyone with sufficient expertise, time, and dedication can build a
state-of-the-art streaming data infrastructure out of these components, with
Morio you won't have to. It is designed to be as user-friendly as it is
powerful: you will be able to configure and manage your observability setup
through an intuitive web UI or a comprehensive REST API. This appliance-like
experience will make it easy for teams of all sizes to deploy and manage their
observability infrastructure without extensive setup time or complexity.

Licensed under the European Union Public License (EUPL), Morio is built to
ensure transparency, flexibility, and freedom in managing your data
infrastructure. By contributing to Morio, you can help shape the future of
observability tools and ensure that it meets the needs of a diverse range of
users. We are pretty excited about it... and we hope that you will be, too!
