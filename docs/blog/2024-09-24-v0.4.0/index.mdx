We have released version 0.4.0 of Morio, which brings a range of new features,
improvements, and fixes, along with a fix for
[CVE-2024-45410][cve] mishandling of HTTP headers in Traefik, which is used in
Morio for the _proxy service_.

## Timing and cadence of Morio releases

The cut-off point for this 0.4 release is a little bit arbitrary. There are
some things we wanted to see in this release that haven't been implemented yet.
However, even though Morio is currently in alpha, we felt it important
to put out an update to address the [CVE in Traefik][cve], which has a rating
of 9.8.

While we could have back ported our fix -- which was a simple as upgrading 
Traefik to 3.1.4 -- we felt we might as well push 0.4 out the door, even if
it is a bit rough around the edges. We are in alpha after all.

Up until this point we've limited ourselves to minor releases, cutting a new
release whenever we have significant new features. Going forward, you can
accept our release cadence to accelerate, as we'll be publishing patch releases
with smaller updates. This will also allow us to streamline our release 
workflows and artefact build pipelines.


## New in Morio 0.4

### Enable access control for all HTTP services

In earlier releases of Morio, access control was not enforced on all HTTP
services, for example the console service.

With this release, all HTTP services are subject to access control.

### Added access control on the Kafka API (with SASL, for now)

Access control was a point of focus for us in this release, and we've also
enabled it on the Kafka API where now in addition to authentication with mTLS,
there is authorisation with SASL. Morio will automatically create a `root` and
`morio-client` user for you and configure an access control list on the broker
that allows the `morio-client` user to produce data, and grants full rights to
the `root` user

This is a bit of a intermediate solution as we prefer to avoid using SASL as it
complicates client configuration. Alas, we hit an issue with using mTLS
authorisation where we were unable to extract the user principal from the
certificate. An issue for which a fix has so far eluded us. 

Once we resolve this, we will switch authorisation back to mTLS and drop SASL.

### Added support for OIDC identity providers

We've added support for a new type of identity provider that allows to
integrate Morio with any provider that support OpenID Connect (OIDC).  

In addition, we've written guides for how to integrate with common providers
that support OIDC, such as
[GitLab](/docs/guides/settings/integrations/gitlab/#gitlab-as-identity-provider-with-openid-connect),
[Google](/docs/guides/settings/integrations/google/), and
[Keycloak](/docs/guides/settings/integrations/keycloak/).

### Added initial support for account labels based on provider attributes

We already had role based access control (RBAC) in Morio, but we plan to extend
that with attribute based access control (ABAC).

The driver behind is is that with the addition of the KV store, Morio will
potentially start storing user data. And while we can decide which role can do
what with regards to managing Morio, we cannot decide in your stead which user
should have access to what data.

This is why we plan to extend access control based on attributes, and while
that is not fully implemented in this release yet, we do already have support
for adding _labels_ to an account based on identity provider attributes. For
example, you can configure Morio to add labels to an account based on the
`groups` attribute in your identity provider, which will allow you (in the
future) to configure access control based on group membership in your
centralised identity provider.

### Initial Key/Value store implementation

Morio now ships with a key/value store on board. 
This is already exposed through the API, although there is no UI component for it. 
That is something we might add later.

We needed a persistent KV store for our own purposes inside Morio, so we created
one that you can access through Morio's _management API_ and is backed by 
our _DB service_.

This is a very simply KV store -- think a poor man's `etcd` -- but if it fully 
distributed on clustered deployments.

Refer to [the KV endpoints in the API reference
documentation](/docs/reference/apis/api/#tag/kv) for more details.

### Rate limiting on the management API

We've added rate limiting to the management API, as part of our efforts to make
Morio more resilient against abuse.

### Allow basic authentication for mrt and apikey providers

The _management API_ has an authentication endpoint where you can trade in your
credentials for a JSON Web Token that you can then use in subsequent requests.
This is the recommended way to interact with the API when you require multiple
request (like from our UI) since authentication of a request with a JWT is 
much more efficient then checking credentials.

However, you might need to only make a single API call, for example to get a value
from the KV store in a CI pipeline. In such a use case, the extra
sign in step adds friction and ends up being slower than making the initial
request with credentials.

For such use cases, we've made changes to allow basic authentication 
for the `apikey` and `mrt` identity providers, as those are the ones 
typically used in an automated way.

### Prevent generating certificates that would grant elevated privileges

Once we start using mTLS for authorisation on the Kafka API, the certificate's
Common Name will determine what a user can do.  Given that Morio allows users
to generate X.509 certificates, we've hardened this endpoint so that users
cannot generate certificates that would grant them elevated permissions on the
broker.

### Support for preseeding and keeping the Morio settings under version control

Morio can now load its settings from a git repository, or even directly from
the GitLab or GitHub API. Both at the initial setup, and for later subsequent
updates.

Facilitating automation has been [one of Morio's design
goals](/docs/guides/goals/) from the very start, so supporting
infrastructure-as-code was something we wanted sooner rather than later.

Refer to [the preseeding guide](/docs/guides/settings/preseed/) for all details.

### Support for integration with Hashicorp Vault

We now support Hashicorp Vault as a backing store for secrets. Refer to [The
Hashicorp Vault integration guide](/docs/guides/settings/integrations/vault/)
for all details.

### New repositories for Moriod packages

We've setup infrastructure to provide APT and RPM repositories from which you can install Morio.
They are:

- [apt.repo.morio.it](https://apt.repo.morio.it/)
- [rpm.repo.morio.it](https://rpm.repo.morio.it/)

Apart from the `moriod` package which installs a morio node, we also provide a `moriod-repo`
package which sets up the repository on your system (currently only supported for APT).
This allows you to install Morio as any regular package through your package manager,
as well as receive future updates.

All packages will be signed with [Morio's key](https://apt.repo.morio.it/morio.asc).
