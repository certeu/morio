After the initial months of design, preparation, and writing code, we've
recently started working on the Morio documentation, including its automated
publishing in a CI pipeline.

We strongly believe that documentation should never be an afterthought, but be
written alongside the code itself.  When trying to explain things in
documentation, those things that are counter-intuitive and awkwardly named
become obvious. And if we document early, we have a chance to intervene before
these tweaks require too many changes.

As we do our work in the open, this means that our documentation too is now _out there_.
Which is great, because it allows for early [feedback](https://github.com/certeu/morio/discussions) on what we're doing, and how we're doing it.

But on the flip side, we need to be concious of
raised expectations, and prevent people from getting dissapointed because their
initial enthusiasm bumps into the still (very) rough edges of Morio.

For this reason, we'd like to clarity what you can expect at this time:

- __Morio is not ready__<br />
  Morio exists in various more or less broken states. We do not have any published releases at this time. We do not even have a stable `main` branch. Use the current Morio only as a learning experience.
- __Documentation is for the desired state__<br />
  As we mentioned, we write our documentation as we make progress on Morio. So often we document the _desired state_ where we are working towards. In other words, the documentation can sometimes be ahead of the implementation, and sometimes behind. The goal is that they will converge over time.


Even though things are not ready for production, for those who have taken an
interest in Morio, we want to make it easy to familiarize yourself with the
project, understand what we are trying to do, and how we are going about doing
it.  We are also open to contributions or ideas that can bring value to
CERT-EU, our constituents, our partners, and our peers.
  
For this reason, we have published the Morio documentation site, rather than
wait.  It's like watching through the oven window as Morio is being baked. It's
exciting to watch it rise, we'd love to hear your thoughts and opinions, but if
you take out Morio now, it will not only cave in, you are also very likely to
burn your hands.

That being said, it already smells great :smile:
