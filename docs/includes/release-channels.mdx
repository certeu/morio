:::tip Morio release channels

Morio releases are provided through different channels that each serve their
specific purpose.

### 📦 Production

This is the default channel. It provides stable releases that have been tested
and gone through an incubation period in the `canary` channel.

**Use this channel unless you have specific reasons not to.**

### 🐣 Canary

The canary channel is where packages stay a while before they graduate to
production. 
A `canary` release allows you to ensure the upcoming release works as expected
in your specific environment, and limits the blast radius in case a problem is
not caught in testing. 

When no issues come up during a `canary` release's incubation period,
it is promoted to `production`.

**We recommend to run the `canary` release on a _staging instance_.**

### 💣 Testing

This channel is used for our integration tests, as well as by developers of
and contributors to Morio to validate fixes or new features.

When a release in `testing` is validated, it graduates to `canary`.

**The `testing` channel is not intended to be used for _real_ deployments.**
