#### OpenBAO Compatibility

After [Hashicorp's decision to re-license its software as
BSL](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/hashicorp-adopts-business-source-license),
Vault was forked as [OpenBAO](https://github.com/openbao/openbao) under the
wing of [the Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/).

For the time being, we have a single implementation that we refer to as `Vault`,
but as OpenBAO aims for API compatibility, you can also read it as `OpenBao`.

That being said, we currently only test against Hashicorp Vault.
