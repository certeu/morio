Need a little hand? No worries, you're not alone.

Morio is under active development and currently in alpha.
Some things might be broken, or simply not implemented yet.

But we value all contributors, and want this to be a pleasant
experience for you. So if you are stuck, please let us know
because it is unlikely you are the only one facing issues.

Here's some ways you can reach out to the people behind Morio:

- Morio Documentation: https://morio.it/
    Have you read the fine manual (RTFM)?
    We work really hard on our documenation so we want you to read
    it. Not just to learn, but also to tell us how we can do better.

- GitHub Discussions: https://github.com/certeu/morio/discussions
    If your question is not answered by teh documentation, do not
    hesitate to create a question here.
    This has the benefit of being public, so once a question is
    answered, others can read it, or can find it via Google.

- GitHub Issues: https://github.com/certeu/morio/issues
    If you feel it's not really a question but more of a problem
    report -- and you have considered the fact that Morio is in
    alpha right now -- you can create an issue. Which is like a
    ticket if you will. Note that this too will be publicly
    accessible.

- Contact us
    If you have an SLA with CERT-EU, please use the
    usual channels for your inquiry.

    If not, and you have considered the options above and they do
    not work for you for some reason, you can contact us directly.

    However, please keep in mind that this does not scale very well,
    and you are relying on people's free time to help you.
    That being said, you can reach out to the Morio maintainer, joost:

      - Mastodon: https://freesewing.social/@joost
      - Email: joost@joost.at


And remember to not get discouraged.
Nobody knows everything.
But together, we may be able to figure it out.
