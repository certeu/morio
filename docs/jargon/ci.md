__CI__ stands for __Continious Integration__. In the context of Morio, we use
it as shorthand for CI/CD, which combines CI with __Continious Deployment__. We
use CI to refer to the automation in building, testing, and deploying changes
in software.

To learn more, the [CI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration)
and [CI/CD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD) articles on Wikipedia are a
good starting point.
