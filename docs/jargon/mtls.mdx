title: mTLS
---

**mTLS** or **Mutual TLS** utilises Transport Layer Security (TLS) to not only
authenticate the server by its certificate, but also the client.

It is an authentication method that identifies both parties with a certificate,
rather than the much more common TLS where only the server is identified.
