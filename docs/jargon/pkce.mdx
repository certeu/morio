**Proof Key for Code Exchange** or **PKCE** (pronounced _pixy_) is an OpenID
Connect flow that is specifically designed to protect against authorization
code interception attacks.

It is typically used in scenarios where the client secret cannot be protected,
  such as native mobile apps, or single page applications.

While the Morio UI service is a single page application, any OpenID Connect
client secret is not available in the frontend code since the OpenID flow is
initiated by the Morio API service.

Still, Morio implements the PKCE flow for OpenID Connect as an extra layer of
protection according to the _defense in depth_ pricinple.
