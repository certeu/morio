- Figure out a robust way to generate the container start script
  keeping in mind the volume mapping of different folders.
  Perhaps we should use environment variables, and allow them
  to be set prior to install
- Create a unit file for systemd, something like:
```
[Unit]
Description=My Nginx Container
Requires=docker.service
After=docker.service

[Service]
Restart=always
ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker run --rm --name mynginx -p 80:80 mynginx
ExecStop=/usr/bin/docker stop mynginx

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

- Create package structure (we probably want to support both RPM and DEB)
- Create binary moriod file
- Create man page
- Create command completion
- Build package
