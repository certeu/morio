## Morio templates

We do not keep these templates in the main Morio repository. Instead, we use the
[morio-templates](https://github.com/certeu/morio-templates) repository where we 
curate various templates.

Refer to [the preseeding guide](https://morio.it/docs/guides/settings/preseed/)
to learn how you can load these templates into your Morio install.
